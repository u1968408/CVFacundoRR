## Project analysis

  -	**Characterize the final user: who will be the final user? What is he/she expected to find in your project?**

This page conforms a 'Curriculum Vitae', directed to a possible employer. Inside it we can find information abou the education, courses and skills of the job seeker, and ways for the employer to contact this individual. The largest portion of the CV is destined to show a summary of employment experiences of the job aplicant, written in a way reminiscent of .css code. With the summon of all this informations, an employer could determine if the aplicant could be usefull to it's business, in order to then call or not the later to a job enterview.


  -	**Information architecture: in this project, which is assumed to be a single page project, this analysis isnâ€™t very relevant.**

The page is only formed with two primary files, the index.html file and a ProgrammerStyle.css file, apart from the resorces like fonts and images.


  -	**Visual design: which color palette will you use? Which typography? Which page layout? Look for inspirational similar projects.**

**Color palette:** ![Palette](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/890553627188535306/1041425933384568942/Palette.png) -> #252526 / #519CD6 / #9FD7F7 / #7F7F7F / #F6D700 / #DADCAA / #679955 / #CCCCCC

**Typography:** The information section is writtern in font Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; while the experience part is written in font CodeNewRoman.

**Page layout:**
This CV is designed to imitate a .css file, opened in Visual Studio Code, mainly because it's directed to jobs related to computering and programming. We can differentiate to different sections, one located in the left part of the page and the other one in it's right. In the left section we can find the job seeker's information in a way that hints a file explorer, while in the right part of the CV we can see the experience section, written in a way reminiscent of .css code. On top of the page we can see another reference, which hints the file's windows opened in the program.
